EDI follows a high metadata standard that ensures that your future self and others can utilize data for scientific and other inquiry forms.\n\n\n### What you need to do\n- Read this guide carefully to familiarize yourself with basic concepts on publishing environmental/ecological data.\n- Look into the **\"Your turn\"** section at the end of this guide. Here you well find step by step what you need to have in place to successfully publish your data.\n\n\n### Why PADL?\n\nWe want a centralized place where scientists and managers can access all data collected at Palmyra Atoll. Data are among the most valuable outputs of research. If no one can access these data, all the data collection can be a waste of resources. An open data library allows for aggregating and synthesizing data from different contexts. This is essential to establishing broader ecological knowledge and informing conservation management. Long-term data are crucial to understanding historical patterns and baselines in a changing world. PADL wants to make it easy for scientists to know and access research done at Palmyra in the past.\n\n\n### Questions?\nPlease contact [ADD CONTACT INFORMATION]\n\n\n## Credits\n\nThis guide borrows heavily from [EDI resources](https://edirepository.org/resources/resources-for-data-authors), [CAP LTER Getting Started Guide](https://caplter.github.io/caplter_ezeml/#getting-started) and [NCEAS coreR curriculum](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/learning-hub/core-r).
