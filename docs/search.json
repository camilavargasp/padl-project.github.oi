    "text": "The Palmyra Atoll Data Library (PADL) aims to publish as much data collected at Palmyra Atoll as possible.\nWe believe that facilitating access to research and its associated data will amplify academic discussions, help other researchers, and further inform management and policy decisions being made in Palmyra and other tropical ecosystems.\nWe are working with the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI), an NSF-supported initiative that provides a reliable, registered and certified trustworthy data repository with an open-access API. EDI follows a high metadata standard that ensures that your future self and others can utilize data for scientific and other forms of inquiry.\n\n\nWe want to have a centralized place where scientist and managers have access to all data collected at Palmyra Atoll. We believe that data are among the most valuable outputs of research. If no-one can access these data, all the data collection is a shocking waste of resources. Having an open data library allows for aggregating and synthesizing data from different contexts. This is essential to establishing broader ecological knowledge and informing conservation management. Long-term data are crucial to understand historical patterns and baselines in a changing world. PADL wants to make it easy for scientist to know and have access to research done at Palmyra in the past."

If you are planning to publish you data elsewhere we ask to please collect the metadata following EDI metadata standards presented in this guide.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect from this guide\n\nThe goal of this guide is for you to know what you need to do to be in compliance with TNC Palmyra Data Sharing Agreement.\nCHECK: We provide some orientation and tips for when planning your data collection and\nGo in-depth on how to publish your data using the ezEML tool suite developed by the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI).\nWe also provide metadata templates for you to know and plan on documenting your data from the get go.\nWe highly recommend to have a plan for collecting your metadata since the beginning of your research life cycle.\nAccording to EDI experience “continuous creation of metadata during the research life cycle greatly benefits data management during a project and when it comes time to publish data when the project concludes”.\n\n\n\n\nfrom edirepository.org, Creating Metadata During the Research Life Cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis guide borrows heavily from EDI resources, CAP LTER Getting Started Guide and NCEAS coreR curriculum.

    "text": "Data Package\n\nEDI publishes data from the ecological and environmental sciences irrespective of funding origin.\nThe unit of publication is called a data package.\nThis is an assemblage of science metadata, the data it self, and any other file you want to publish with your data.\nThe basic rule of thumb is to package your data in the form you would like to receive it.\nEach data package is assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and published in the repository for future use.\nEDI resources on data packages\n\nMetadata\n\nThe metadata is the data that provides information about your data. It describe the structure, content, and context of your data.\nThey are vital to the discovery and reuse of data, and are a required element of a data package.\nEDI resources on Creating Metadata for a Data Package\n\nEcological Metadata Language (EML)\n\nEDI uses the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) format to document the metadata in each data package.\n“EML provides a comprehensive vocabulary and a readable XML markup syntax for documenting research data. It is a community-maintained specification, and evolves to meet the data documentation needs of researchers who want to openly document, preserve, and share data and outputs” (Jones et al, 2019).\n\nezEML\n\nEDI created a user-friendly tool that streamlined the process of the creating metadata in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML).\nezEML is a form-based online application that leads the user through EML document creation step by step.\nCheck out EDI ezEML User Guide for more information."
