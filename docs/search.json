    "text": "The Palmyra Atoll Data Library (PADL) aims to publish as much data collected at Palmyra Atoll as possible.\nWe believe that facilitating access to research and its associated data will amplify academic discussions, help other researchers, and further inform management and policy decisions being made in Palmyra and other tropical ecosystems.\nWe are working with the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI), an NSF-supported initiative that provides a reliable, registered and certified trustworthy data repository with an open-access API. EDI follows a high metadata standard that ensures that your future self and others can utilize data for scientific and other forms of inquiry.\n\n\nWe want to have a centralized place where scientist and managers have access to all data collected at Palmyra Atoll. We believe that data are among the most valuable outputs of research. If no-one can access these data, all the data collection is a shocking waste of resources. Having an open data library allows for aggregating and synthesizing data from different contexts. This is essential to establishing broader ecological knowledge and informing conservation management. Long-term data are crucial to understand historical patterns and baselines in a changing world. PADL wants to make it easy for scientist to know and have access to research done at Palmyra in the past."

If you are planning to publish you data elsewhere we ask to please follow EDI metadata standards presented in this guide.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect from this guide\n\nThe goal of this guide is for you to know what you need to do to be in compliance with TNC Palmyra Data Sharing Agreement.\nHere we go in-depth on how to publish your data using the ezEML tool suite developed by the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI).\nWe also provide metadata templates for you to know and plan on documenting your data from the get go.\nWe highly recommend to have a plan for collecting your metadata since the beginning of your research life cycle.\nAccording to EDI’s experience “continuous creation of metadata during the research life cycle greatly benefits data management during a project and when it comes time to publish data when the project concludes”.\n\n\n\n\nfrom edirepository.org, Creating Metadata During the Research Life Cycle"
