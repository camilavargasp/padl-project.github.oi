    "text": "The Palmyra Atoll Data Library (PADL) aims to publish as much data collected at Palmyra Atoll as possible.\nFacilitating access to research and its associated data will amplify academic discussions, help other researchers, and further inform the management and policy decisions in Palmyra and other tropical ecosystems.\nWe are working with the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI), an NSF-supported initiative that provides a reliable, registered, and certified trustworthy data repository with an open-access API. EDI follows a high metadata standard that ensures that your future self and others can utilize data for scientific and other inquiry forms.\n\n\n\nRead this guide carefully to familiarize yourself with basic concepts on publishing environmental/ecological data.\nLook into the “Your turn” section at the end of this guide. Here you well find step by step what you need to have in place to successfully publish your data.\n\n\n\n\nWe want a centralized place where scientists and managers can access all data collected at Palmyra Atoll. Data are among the most valuable outputs of research. If no one can access these data, all the data collection can be a waste of resources. An open data library allows for aggregating and synthesizing data from different contexts. This is essential to establishing broader ecological knowledge and informing conservation management. Long-term data are crucial to understanding historical patterns and baselines in a changing world. PADL wants to make it easy for scientists to know and access research done at Palmyra in the past.\n\n\n\nPlease contact [ADD CONTACT INFORMATION]\n\n\n\nThis guide borrows heavily from EDI resources, CAP LTER Getting Started Guide and NCEAS coreR curriculum. Check out the links and see the complete citation in the reference section."

If you plan to publish your data elsewhere, please collect the metadata following the EDI standards presented in this guide. You will then have to submit your metadata to TNC Palmyra.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThe goal of this guide is for you to know what you need to do to comply with TNC Palmyra Data Sharing Agreement.\nWe provide some orientation and tips for planning your data collection and resources to learn more about tidy data.\nWe describe each of the elements needed to best document your data.\nThis guide goes in-depth on how to publish your data using the ezEML tool suite developed by the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI).\nWe also provide metadata templates for you to know and plan on documenting your data from the get-go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe highly recommend having a plan for collecting your metadata since the beginning of your research life cycle. According to EDI experience, “continuous creation of metadata during the research life cycle greatly benefits data management during a project and when it comes time to publish data when the project concludes.”\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom edirepository.org, Creating Metadata During the Research Life Cycle"

For C. microrhinos, the project was designed to collect fine-scale spatial behavior data, focusing on territory size, species interactions, and benthic impact (i.e. feeding behavior). Focal follow data was collected by one or two observer(s), either on snorkel or SCUBA, and recording focal activity down to the second. Simultaneously, the observer would be towing a GPS that was recording a location every 5 seconds and each location was then associated with a particular behavior. Throughout this study individual fish were identifiable and successive follows were possible on individuals. For C. spilurus the focus of the project was to collect behavioral time budget data on feeding, territorial defense, and spawning behavior. The ‘Chlorurus_Area_Palmyra_2014.csv’ data only covers C. Microrhinos and gives the 95% KUD area estimation for GPS towed tracks, as well as the 95% KUD area for locations where feeding was occurring. We also report the step length between successive points for the entire follow as well as where feeding was occurring.\nThe ‘Chlorurus_Activity_Palmyra_2014.csv’ is for both C. Microrhinos and C. spilurus and reports the start and stop time of each focal follow as well as the start and stop time of each activity. Activity descriptions can be found in the metadata and the total length and phase for each individual in our study can be found in Fish_Information_Chlorurus_Data_2014.csv."

Individual fish were identified by unique markings on the face, tail, and body as well as missing scales or scars. A diver would identify an individual fish and follow the fish for 2-3mins before stating the focal follow. The diver would tow a GPS that was recording a position every 5 secs and synchronized the time on their wrist watch to the GPS time. The diver would then follow the fish and record the start and stop time of each activity, while also following the path of the fish. GPS tracks were downloaded and each position was associated with an activity and activity summaries were calculated. For C. Microrhinos we calculated the 95% kernel utilization distributions (KUD) for the entire focal follow as well as for only the locations categorized as ‘feeding’. All KUD estimates were done in R with the adehabitatHR package."
