    "text": "The Palmyra Atoll Data Library (PADL) aims to publish as much data collected at Palmyra Atoll as possible.\nWe believe that facilitating access to research and its associated data will amplify academic discussions, help other researchers, and further inform management and policy decisions being made in Palmyra and other tropical ecosystems.\nWe are working with the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI), an NSF-supported initiative that provides a reliable, registered and certified trustworthy data repository with an open-access API. EDI follows a high metadata standard that ensures that your future self and others can utilize data for scientific and other forms of inquiry.\n\n\nWe want to have a centralized place where scientist and managers have access to all data collected at Palmyra Atoll. We believe that data are among the most valuable outputs of research. If no-one can access these data, all the data collection is a shocking waste of resources. Having an open data library allows for aggregating and synthesizing data from different contexts. This is essential to establishing broader ecological knowledge and informing conservation management. Long-term data are crucial to understand historical patterns and baselines in a changing world. PADL wants to make it easy for scientist to know and have access to research done at Palmyra in the past.\n\n\n\nThis guide borrows heavily from EDI resources, CAP LTER Getting Started Guide and NCEAS coreR curriculum. Check out the links and see complete citation on the reference section."

    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nWe understand that EDI might not be suitable to all data. If you are planning to publish you data elsewhere we ask to please collect the metadata following EDI metadata standards presented in this guide and submit your metadata to TNC Palmyra.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThe goal of this guide is for you to know what you need to do to be in compliance with TNC Palmyra Data Sharing Agreement.\nWe provide some orientation and tips for when planning your data collection, together with resources to learn more about tidy data.\nWe describe each of the elements needed to best document your data.\nThis guide goes in-depth on how to publish your data using the ezEML tool suite developed by the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI).\nWe also provide metadata templates for you to know and plan on documenting your data from the get go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe highly recommend to have a plan for collecting your metadata since the beginning of your research life cycle. According to EDI experience “continuous creation of metadata during the research life cycle greatly benefits data management during a project and when it comes time to publish data when the project concludes”.\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom edirepository.org, Creating Metadata During the Research Life Cycle"

It describe the structure, content, and context of your data.\nThey are vital to the discovery and reuse of data, and are a required element of a data package.\nEDI resources on Creating Metadata for a Data Package\n\nEcological Metadata Language (EML)\n\nEDI uses the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) format to document the metadata in each data package.\n“EML provides a comprehensive vocabulary and a readable XML markup syntax for documenting research data. It is a community-maintained specification, and evolves to meet the data documentation needs of researchers who want to openly document, preserve, and share data and outputs” (Jones et al, 2019).\n\nezEML\n\nEDI created a user-friendly tool that streamlined the process of the creating metadata in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML).\nezEML is a form-based online application that leads the user through EML document creation step by step.\nCheck out EDI ezEML User Guide for more information.\n\nOCID ID\n“a free, unique, persistent identifier for researchers. Having an ORCID distinguishes researchers with similar names, ensures that scientific output is correctly attributed, and improves the overall discoverability of scientific products. Linking data publications to an ORCID profile ensures that research contributions are correctly attributed across scholarly databases.”\n\nWe highly recommend creating a ORCID\nYou can use your ORCID t log in to ezEML FROM EDI NEEDS TO BE REVISED"

If your data package is associated with a journal article, your data package abstract need to be different than the one in the article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nData was collected at Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge located in the Central Pacific in 2014, and the work focuses on two species of Parrotfish, Chlorurus microrhinos and Chlorurus spilurus (formerly Cholrurus sordidus). For C. microrhinos, the project was designed to collect fine-scale spatial behavior data, focusing on territory size, species interactions, and benthic impact (i.e. feeding behavior). Focal follow data was collected by one or two observer(s), either on snorkel or SCUBA, and recording focal activity down to the second. Simultaneously, the observer would be towing a GPS that was recording a location every 5 seconds and each location was then associated with a particular behavior. Throughout this study individual fish were identifiable and successive follows were possible on individuals. For C. spilurus the focus of the project was to collect behavioral time budget data on feeding, territorial defense, and spawning behavior. The ‘Chlorurus_Area_Palmyra_2014.csv’ data only covers C. Microrhinos and gives the 95% KUD area estimation for GPS towed tracks, as well as the 95% KUD area for locations where feeding was occurring. We also report the step length between successive points for the entire follow as well as where feeding was occurring.\nThe ‘Chlorurus_Activity_Palmyra_2014.csv’ is for both C. Microrhinos and C. spilurus and reports the start and stop time of each focal follow as well as the start and stop time of each activity. Activity descriptions can be found in the metadata and the total length and phase for each individual in our study can be found in ’Fish_Information_Chlorurus_Data_2014.csv."

Individual fish were identified by unique markings on the face, tail, and body as well as missing scales or scars. A diver would identify an individual fish and follow the fish for 2-3mins before stating the focal follow. The diver would tow a GPS that was recording a position every 5 secs and synchronized the time on their wrist watch to the GPS time. The diver would then follow the fish and record the start and stop time of each activity, while also following the path of the fish. GPS tracks were downloaded and each position was associated with an activity and activity summaries were calculated. For C. Microrhinos we calculated the 95% kernel utilization distributions (KUD) for the entire focal follow as well as for only the locations categorized as ‘feeding’. All KUD estimates were done in R with the adehabitatHR package."
