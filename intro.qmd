# PADL Publishing Data Guide {.unnumbered}

We created this guide to help you document your data in a way that facilitates the process of publishing your data or metadata to EDI. Here we describe what you need to do to make your data publicly available through the EDI repository.

::: callout-note
We understand that EDi is not suitable to all data. If you are planning to publish you data elsewhere we ask to please follow EDI metadata standards presented in this guide.

### What to expect from this guide

-   The goal of this guide is for you to know what you need to do to be in compliance with TNC Palmyra Data Sharing Agreement.
-   Here we go in-depth on how to publish your data using the [ezEML](https://ezeml.edirepository.org/eml/) tool suite developed by the Environmental Data Initiative [(EDI)](https://edirepository.org/).
-   We also provide metadata templates for you to know and plan on documenting your data from the get go.
-   We highly recommend to have a plan for collecting your metadata since the beginning of your research life cycle.
-   According to EDI's experience "continuous creation of metadata during the research life cycle greatly benefits data management during a project and when it comes time to publish data when the project concludes".
