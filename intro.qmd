# PADL Publishing Data Guide

We created this guide to help you document your data in a way that facilitates the process of publishing your data to EDI. Here we will describe what you need to do to make your data publicly available through the EDI repository.

### Why publish your data?

-   Data are among the most valuable outputs of research

-   If no-one can access these data, all the data collection is a shocking waste of resources.

-   Aggregate and synthesis of data from different contexts is essential to establishing broader ecological knowledge and informing conservation management

-   Long-term data are essential to understand historical patterns and baselines in a changing world

-   Know about and have access to research done in the past
